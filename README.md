# **Movie Recommendation System: Exploring Knowledge-Based, Similarity-Based, and Matrix Factorization-Based Approaches for Personalized Movie Recommendations**

## **Context**
Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repository and if we can build a **Recommendation System** to recommend **relevant movies** to users, based on their **historical interactions**, this would **improve customer satisfaction** and hence, it will also improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, it can be any item for which you want to build a recommendation system.


## **Objective**
In this project I will be building various recommendation systems: 
- Knowledge/Rank based recommendation system
- Similarity-Based Collaborative filtering
- Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering

I am going to use the **ratings** dataset which I have uploaded in csv format. 


## **Dataset**
The **ratings** dataset contains the following attributes: 
- userId
- movieId
- rating
- timestamp
